Input:
- arr: the input array
- index: the index of the element to be popped
- size: the current size of the array

Output:
- arr: the updated array with the element popped
- size: the updated size of the array

Steps:
1. Check if index is within bounds (0 â‰¤ index < size).
2. If index is out of bounds, return an error.
3. Shift all elements to the right of index one position to the left.
4. Decrement size by 1.
5. Return the updated arr and size.

Time Complexity:
- O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the index and size variables.
